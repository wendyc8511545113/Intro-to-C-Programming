/*
Write a program named TestScoreList that accepts eight int values representing student test scores.
Display each of the values along with a message that indicates how far it is from the average.

An example of how the results should be output is as follows:
Test # 0:    89 From average:     6
Test # 1:    78 From average:    -5
...
