/*
Create a program named PaintingEstimate whose Main() method prompts a user for length and width of a room in feet. Create a method that accepts the values and then computes the cost of painting the room, assuming the room is rectangular and has four full walls and 9-foot ceilings. The price of the job is $6 per square foot. Return the price to the Main() method, and display it.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter length of the room in feet >> 30
Enter width of room in feet >> 16
Cost of job for 30 X 16 foot room is $4,968.00
*/

using System;
using static System.Console;
using System.Globalization;

class PaintingEstimate
{
	static void Main()
	{
		// Prompt a user for length and width of a room in feet.
		WriteLine("Enter the length of the room in feet: ");
		double length = Convert.ToDouble(ReadLine());

		WriteLine("Enter the width of the room in feet: ");
		double width = Convert.ToDouble(ReadLine());

		// Return and display the price with proper currency formatting
		double totalCost = CalculateCosts(length, width);
		WriteLine("Cost of job for {0} X {1} foot room is {2}", 
			length, width, totalCost.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
	}

	static double CalculateCosts(double length, double width)
	{
		// Constants
		const double height = 9;
		const double costPerSQFT = 6;

		// Correct wall area calculation
		double wallArea = 2 * (length + width) * height;

		// Return the total cost
		return wallArea * costPerSQFT;
