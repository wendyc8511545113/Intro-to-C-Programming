/*
Create a program named PaintingEstimate whose Main() method prompts a user for length and width of a room in feet. Create a method that accepts the values and then computes the cost of painting the room, assuming the room is rectangular and has four full walls and 9-foot ceilings. The price of the job is $6 per square foot. Return the price to the Main() method, and display it.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter length of the room in feet >> 30
Enter width of room in feet >> 16
Cost of job for 30 X 16 foot room is $4,968.00
