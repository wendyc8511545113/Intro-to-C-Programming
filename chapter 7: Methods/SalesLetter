/*
Create a program named SalesLetter whose Main() method uses several WriteLine() calls to display a sales letter to prospective clients for a business of your choice. Display your contact information at least three times in the letter. The contact information should contain at least three lines with data such as land line phone number and/or cellphone number, email address, and web address.. Each time you want to display the contact information, call a method named DisplayContactInfo().

An example of the program is shown below:
