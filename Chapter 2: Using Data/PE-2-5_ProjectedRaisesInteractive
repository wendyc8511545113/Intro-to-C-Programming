/*
Convert the ProjectedRaises class to an interactive application named ProjectedRaisesInteractive. Instead of assigning values to the salaries, accept them from the user as input.

Output for each employee should be formatted similar to the following example for the first employee: Next year's salary for the first employee will be $26,000.00.

Note: The salary in the output will change depending on the user input.

In order to prepend the $ to currency values, the program will need to use the CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo method. In order to do this, include the statement using 
System.Globalization; at the top of your program and format the output statements as follows: WriteLine("This is an example: {0}", value.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
