/*
Malcolm Movers charges a base rate of $200 per move plus $150 per hour and $2 per mile.

Write a program named MoveEstimator that prompts a user for and accepts estimates for the number of hours for a job and the number of miles involved in the move and displays the total moving fee.

For example, if 25 hours and 55 miles are input the output would be displayed as: For a move taking 25 hours and going 55 miles the estimate is $4,060.00

In order to prepend the $ to currency values, the program will need to use the CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo method. In order to do this, include the statement using 
System.Globalization; at the top of your program and format the output statements as follows: WriteLine("This is an example: {0}", value.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
*/

using System;
using static System.Console;
using System.Globalization;
class MoveEstimator
{
	static void Main()
	{
		Write("Hours worked: ");
		string userHrWk = ReadLine();
		double hoursWorked = Convert.ToDouble(userHrWk);

		Write("Distance in Miles: ");
		string userMiles = ReadLine();
		double miles = Convert.ToDouble(userMiles);

		double estimatedCost = 200 + (hoursWorked * 150) + (2 * miles);

		WriteLine("For a move taking {0} hours and going {1} miles the estimate is {2}", userHrWk, userMiles, estimatedCost.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
