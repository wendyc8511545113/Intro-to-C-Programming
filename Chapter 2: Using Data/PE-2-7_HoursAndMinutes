Write a program named HoursAndMinutes that declares a minutes variable to represent minutes worked on a job, and assign a value to it.

Display the value in hours and minutes. For example, if 98 is assigned to the minutes variable, the output would be: 98 minutes is 1 hours and 38 minutes.

Note: For final submission assign 197 to the minutes variable
