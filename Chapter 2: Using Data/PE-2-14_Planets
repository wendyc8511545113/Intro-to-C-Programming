Create an enumeration named Planet that holds the names for the eight planets in our solar system, starting with MERCURY equal to 1 and ending with NEPTUNE.

Write a program named Planets that prompts the user for a numeric position, and display the name of the planet that is in the requested position.

For example, if 3 is input, the output would be: EARTH is 3 planet(s) from the sun
