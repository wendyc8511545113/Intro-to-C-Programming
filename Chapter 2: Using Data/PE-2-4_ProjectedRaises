/*
Write a C# program named ProjectedRaises that includes a named constant representing next year’s anticipated 4 percent raise for each employee in a company.

Also declare variables to represent the current salaries for three employees. Assign values to the variables, and display, with explanatory text, next year’s salary for each employee.

Note: For final submission assign the following current salaries for the employees: 25000 for employee 1, 38000 for employee 2, 51000 for employee 3.

Then next year's salary for employee 1 would be displayed as: Next year's salary for the first employee will be $26,000.00

In order to prepend the $ to currency values, the program will need to use the CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo method. In order to do this, include the statement using System.Globalization; 
at the top of your program and format the output statements as follows: WriteLine("This is an example: {0}", value.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
*/

using System;
using static System.Console;
using System.Globalization;
class ProjectedRaises
{
	static void Main()
	{
		// Named constant for the 4% pay raise
		const double payRaise = 0.04;

		//Current salaries variables
		double employee1current = 25000;
		double employee2current = 38000;
		double employee3current = 51000;

		double newSalary1 = employee1current * (1 + payRaise);
		WriteLine("Next year's salary for the first employee will be {0}", newSalary1.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));

		double newSalary2 = employee2current * (1 + payRaise);
		WriteLine("Next year's salary for the second employee will be {0}", newSalary2.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));

		double newSalary3 = employee3current * (1 + payRaise);
		WriteLine("Next year's salary for the third employee will be {0}", newSalary3.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
	}
}
