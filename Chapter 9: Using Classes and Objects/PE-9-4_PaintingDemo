/*
Create a program named PaintingDemo that instantiates an array of eight Room objects and demonstrates the Room methods.

The Room constructor requires parameters for length, width, and height fields (all of type int); use a variety of values when constructing the objects.

The Room class also contains the following fields:

Area - The wall area of the Room (as an int)
Gallons - The number of gallons of paint needed to paint the room (as an int)
Both of these values are computed by calling private methods. Include read-only properties to get a Roomâ€™s values.

A room is assumed to have four walls, and you do not need to allow for windows and doors, and you do not need to allow for painting the ceiling. 
A room requires one gallon of paint for every 350 square feet (plus an extra gallon for any square feet greater than 350). 
In other words, a 12 x 3 x 10 room with 9-foot ceilings has 396 square feet of wall space, and so requires two gallons of paint.
