/*
In Chapter 4 of your book, you created a program that generates a random number, allows a user to guess it, and displays a message indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

Now, create a modified program called GuessingGame2 in which the user can continue to enter values until the correct guess is made. After the user guesses correctly, display the number of guesses made.

Recall that you can generate a random number whose value is at least min and less than max using the following statements:

Random ranNumber = new Random();
int randomNumber;
randomNumber = ranNumber.Next(min, max);
